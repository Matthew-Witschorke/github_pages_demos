    <h3>The Overview</h3>
    <p>The Porsche 918 Spyer was produced from 2013 to 2015 competing against the Bugatti Veyron, La Ferrari, and the McLaren P1 with only 918 units being made. The 918 is powered by a 4.6L V8 producing 599 horsepower, and is further equiped with a front and rear axel electric engine
        producing a combined 887hp experience. All of this is delivered to a break necking all-wheel drive(AWD) system that enables a consistant 2.5 seconds 0-62mph time and some independent testers achieving 2.2 second times. Porsche hybrid drive technology offers efficiency and uncompromising 
        dynamic performance in equal measure. Porsche had already taken on this pioneering role in the development of plug-in hybrids with the Panamera S E-Hybrid. Now Porsche is expanding this role in the super sportscar segment thanks to the 918 Spyder. The key to this is the targeted use of the 
        combustion engine and two electric motors while exploiting the specific benefits offered by each power unit. Drivers can choose from five driving modes that allow optimum control of the single or mixed drive through the 4.6-litre, eight-cylinder engine delivering 447 kW (608 hp) and the two 
        electric motors with a combined 210 kW (286 hp). The vehicle's range extends from pure electric driving over a distance of 30 kilometres and more, through to the uncompromising configuration for the race track. The 918 Spyder fulfils its claim of being capable of setting records for top racing 
        drivers, while at the same time being an uncomplicated sportscar for day-to-day use.

    <h3>The Impact</h3>
    <p>The dynamic performance of the 918 is possible courtesy of the unique all-wheel drive concept with a combined combustion engine and electric motor drive system on the rear axle and a second electric motor on the front axle. This concept is based on Porsche's motorsport development work for the successful 
        911 GT3 R hybrid. The additional, individually controllable front-wheel drive enables new driving strategies to be used for extremely high yet safe speeds through bends in particular. What's more, the advanced Boost strategy provides an intelligent means of managing the energy of the electric drive. 
        The strategy ensures that all it takes for the unrestricted total power of the 918 Spyder to be harnessed is by fully depressing the accelerator pedal, to have maximum acceleration at every burst of speed.Porsche's future generations of sportscar will benefit from the pioneering achievements in this 
        technology benchmark. The 918 Spyder embodies the traditional Porsche virtue, while providing impressive evidence of the potential provided by plug-in technology for maximum coverage between performance and efficiency. In short, the 918 Spyder contains the genetic blueprint for the Porsche sportscar of the future.
